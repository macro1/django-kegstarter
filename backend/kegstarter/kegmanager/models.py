"""
Some assumptions to keep things simple:
1. You only disconnect kegs to take them back to a vendor, so the tap they're
   on is sufficient location info.
2. Empty kegs will either be refilled or will be returned and the deposit put
   back into the keg fund, so you don't need to keep track of deposits.
3. Beer is always good; it doesn't _really_ matter what we stock. We should use
   a very basic voting system.
