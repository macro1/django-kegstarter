Kegstarter CSS
==============

This is mainly a placeholder directory for overriding bootstrap styles.
If you find you want to create a brand new style, then put it in
``kegstarter.[[original bootstrap name]].less``. If it doesn't map to
some original bootstrap file, then create a new file for your style
group by functionality. Generally though, it should map to some existing
bootstrap file.
